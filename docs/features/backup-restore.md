# Backup & Restore

![Backup & Restore](/screenshots/backup-restore.png)

VaultLens can create and restore full backups of all KV secrets across all mounted engines.

## Creating a Backup

Navigate to **Admin → Backup & Restore** and click **Create Backup Now**. VaultLens:

1. Lists all KV engines
2. Recursively lists all secret paths in each engine
3. Reads every secret (using the system token)
4. Writes a single timestamped JSON file containing all secrets and their metadata

Backup files are stored in the configured `VAULTLENS_BACKUP_PATH` directory (default: `/backups`).

## Restoring a Backup

1. Click **Restore** next to any backup in the list
2. Confirm the restore
3. VaultLens writes all secrets from the backup back to Vault using the system token

::: warning
Restore is additive — it writes secrets from the backup but does not delete secrets that exist in Vault but not in the backup. Existing secrets at the same paths will be overwritten.
:::

## Backup Schedule

Configure automatic backups under **Admin → Backup & Restore → Backup Schedule**:

- **Enable scheduled backups** — turns the scheduler on or off
- **Vault backup** — Raft snapshot when available, otherwise a KV JSON export
- **VaultLens backup** — the application settings backup described below
- **Cron expression** — 5-field `MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW` format (e.g. `0 2 * * *` for daily at 2 AM), with quick presets for common schedules

At least one of **Vault backup** or **VaultLens backup** must be selected to enable the schedule. Both can be selected together — the scheduler runs whichever types are enabled on every due occurrence.

The backup scheduler runs at server startup and checks every minute for due backups.

## Backup File Format

Backup files are JSON with the structure:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "engines": {
    "secret/": {
      "type": "kv",
      "version": 2,
      "secrets": {
        "myapp/config": {
          "data": { "username": "admin", "password": "..." },
          "metadata": { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Downloading & Uploading Backups

Backup files can be downloaded directly from the Admin UI for off-site storage. You can also upload a previously downloaded backup file to restore from it.

## Application Backup

Separately from Vault secrets, VaultLens can back up **its own settings** — everything configured under **Admin → Features**, **Admin → Branding**, **Admin → Webhooks**, and the backup schedule itself, plus any custom developer integration guide overrides (**Auth Methods → Role → Developer Guide**).

Click **Create Application Backup** on the **Admin → Backup & Restore** page to produce an `app-backup-*.json` file containing:

- Every configuration section (feature toggles, branding colours/name, sharing options, webhook definitions, backup schedule, AppRole system-token credentials, etc.)
- Uploaded blobs such as the custom logo
- Any custom developer guide markdown overrides

Custom developer guide overrides are stored on disk under the same mounted directory as VaultLens's other configuration (`VAULTLENS_CONFIG_PATH`, default `/config`), so they survive container restarts and image upgrades, and are included automatically in every application backup.

Restoring an application backup writes these settings back via the same config storage used at runtime — like KV restore, it is additive and overwrites matching sections/keys but does not delete settings that aren't present in the backup.

::: tip
Application backups do not contain Vault secrets. Use a KV or Raft snapshot backup for secret data, and an application backup for VaultLens's own configuration.

## Security Notes

- Backup files contain **all secret values in plaintext** — protect them accordingly
- Backups are performed using the system token, which requires `vaultlens-system` policy permissions
- File-mode backups are stored on the VaultLens server's filesystem; ensure appropriate filesystem permissions
- Application backups may contain encrypted AppRole credentials; they remain encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, key derived from `VAULT_ADDR`) but the file should still be treated as sensitive
